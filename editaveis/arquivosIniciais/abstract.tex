 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

   This paper presents a new proposal for detection of malware patterns in network flows based on artificial neural networks, but using machine learning concepts such as feature engineering on the organization of data models to be used for training the network. The goal is once finished the project, have an intelligent system capable of detecting malware patterns present in packets of network flows and can classify them, so that the network administrator can have a better feedback than a simple dial chance of a packet to be malicious.
