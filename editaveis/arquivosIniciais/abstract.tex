 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

   This paper presents a proposal for the detection of malware patterns in network flows using artificial neural networks working in the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) model and supervised training. The goal is in the end of the project, to have an intelligent system capable of detecting the malware patterns present in packets of network flows and, if possible, to classify them, so that the network administrator has better feedback than a simple A packet is malicious.
